# reverse engineering the old OVGU student card 

This summarizes my reverse engineering from some years ago.
Nowadays the Studentenwerk upgraded the reader rendering the plain
money update futile.

## presentation

The presentation was created with
([landslide](github.com/adamzap/landslide.git)).
The current version is prerendered available in presentation.html.

## scripts

Included are show.sh for viewing relevant data from dumps and
rand.sh for randomizing a dump.

## dumps

Included is the randomized/edited dump (card.mfd) used for
the presentation.
